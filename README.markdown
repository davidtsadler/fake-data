# FAKE_DATA

While working on various projects I often find that I require fake data for testing. The aim of this code is to hopefully generate this fake data from various sources and store in a database. I should then be able to extract this data and put into any format that I requrie.

One example is that I will be scanning my mp3 music collection and storing all the artist, album and track names. I can then turn this into some fake data for an ecommerce site if I need to.
